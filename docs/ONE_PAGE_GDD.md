# One-Page GDD - Dark Side

## High Concept
A large-scale RTS where the player begins as a mobile flagship, secures island resources, and expands into a distributed naval-industrial network. Matches focus on territory control, production tempo, and strategic strikes.

## Player Fantasy
- "I am the command ship."
- "I grow from survival scouting to regional dominance."
- "My drones and missile silos reshape the battlefield."

## Pillars
1. Mobile command identity in early game
2. Island expansion and choke-point control
3. Logistics and production as strategic targets
4. Readable tactical combat with macro depth

## Core Loop
Scout -> Secure resource node -> Build outpost -> Scale economy -> Produce fleets/drones -> Project force with missile silos -> Win by command kill or objective control.

## Economy (MVP)
- **Metal**: unit/building construction
- **Energy**: production throughput, radar/silo abilities
- Outposts increase local build options and resource extraction radius

## Unit/Building Starter Roster
- Flagship (player avatar)
- Constructor Drone (build/repair)
- Attack Drone (cheap harassment)
- Frigate (durable frontline)
- Outpost Hub (territory anchor)
- Missile Silo (cooldown-based long-range strike)

## Win / Lose
- Win: destroy enemy flagship OR control 3 objective sectors for 180 seconds
- Lose: your flagship destroyed

## Art / Tone
Near-future oceanic warfare. Industrial silhouettes, weathered steel, bright tactical VFX for missiles and drone trails.

## MVP Goal
A single playable skirmish map with one AI enemy where player can complete full loop from exploration to silo-supported victory.
